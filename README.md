# Introduction
This project is a data analysis portfolio aimed at segmenting a particular group of mall customers. Using the KMeans unsupervised machine learning algorithm, it will identify and examine univariate, bivariate, and multivariate clusters to categorize customers into unique segments. This segmentation will provide insights into the target audience, enabling the marketing team to develop and customize an effective strategy for engaging the appropriate customers.

# Problem Statement
The project's objective is to:

In order for the marketing team to plan and customize their campaigns, they must comprehend their target audience.
To determine the most effective marketing group and to maximize resources for both customer acquisition and retention, use customer segmentation.
# Key Objectives
- Apply the KMeans clustering algorithm to consumer segmentation.
- Determine the univariate, bivariate, and multivariate customer groupings.
- Examine the summary statistics for each cluster to identify the most suitable marketing group. 
- Offer recommendations to the marketing team to help create an effective strategy.
# Project Workflow
Data Collection: The project begins by gathering customer data from mall records.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and assess the distribution of various customer attributes such as age, income, and spending scores.
Analyze the relationships between different variables.

Customer Segmentation with KMeans: Apply the KMeans algorithm to group customers based on their attributes.
Test different cluster numbers to determine the optimal count.

Cluster Analysis: Identify clusters using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
Interpret the characteristics of each cluster (e.g., high spenders, younger customers, etc.).
